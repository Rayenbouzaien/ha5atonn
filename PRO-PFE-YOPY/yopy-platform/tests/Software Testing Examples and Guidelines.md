## Introduction

This document provides advanced and professional testing ideas to help students design high-quality testing strategies.

Students are encouraged to choose tests based on system complexity, risks, and team size.

## 1 Functional Testing

Objective: Validate that the system behaves according to business requirements.

- • Authentication (login, logout, session expiration)
- • User management (roles, permissions)
- • Core features (CRUD operations)
- • Search and filtering functionality
- • Transactions and workflows Advanced Ideas:
- • Boundary testing (empty values, max values)
- • Invalid input handling
- • Workflow interruption scenarios


## 2 Security Testing (Mandatory)

Objective: Identify vulnerabilities and prevent attacks.

- • SQL Injection
- • Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- • CSRF attacks
- • Unauthorized access attempts
- • Brute force login testing Advanced Ideas:
- • Token expiration validation
- • API security testing (headers, auth)
- • Sensitive data exposure analysis


## 3 Performance and Scalability Testing

Objective: Evaluate system behavior under load.

- • Load testing (multiple users) • Stress testing (system limits) • Scalability testing
- • Response time analysis
- • Database query optimization Advanced Ideas:
- • Identify bottlenecks (API, DB)
- • Measure latency distribution
- • Analyze slow queries


## 4 Indexation and Search Testing

Objective: Validate data retrieval and indexing efficiency.

- • Verify search result relevance
- • Test indexing updates after data insertion
- • Validate sorting and ranking algorithms
- • Check consistency between stored and indexed data Advanced Ideas:
- • Compare search algorithms performance
- • Test large dataset queries
- • Evaluate retrieval speed Important: This is critical for systems using databases, search engines, or AI.


## 5 API Testing

Objective: Validate backend communication.

- • Test endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- • Validate response format (JSON structure)
- • Check status codes (200, 400, 500)
- • Validate error handling Advanced Ideas:
- • Test invalid payloads
- • Simulate network failures
- • Test API authentication


## 6 Usability Testing

Objective: Evaluate user experience.

- • Interface clarity
- • Navigation simplicity
- • Error message clarity Advanced Ideas:
- • Test accessibility (colors, readability)
- • User journey evaluation


## 7 Reliability and Stability Testing

Objective: Ensure long-term system stability.

- • Long execution testing
- • Repeated operations testing
- • Recovery after failure Advanced Ideas:
- • Simulate server crash and recovery
- • Test system consistency after failure


## 8 AI and Recommendation Testing (If Applicable)

Objective: Validate intelligent behavior.

- • Recommendation accuracy
- • Real-time suggestions
- • Algorithm comparison (BFS, A*, Min-Max) Advanced Ideas:
- • Cold-start problem testing
- • Bias detection
- • Consistency of predictions


## 9 Observability and Logging Testing

Objective: Ensure system is monitorable.

- • Verify logs are generated
- • Validate error tracking
- • Check monitoring tools Advanced Ideas:
- • Log completeness
- • Debugging trace validation


## 10 Final Advice

### Minimum Requirements:

- • At least 3 testing categories
- • Mandatory security testing
- • Real execution with evidence


Professional Mindset: Instead of:

"We tested search" Say:

"We evaluated the relevance, performance, and consistency of the search engine under normal and edge-case conditions."

Key Idea: Test like an engineer, not like a student.
