# YOPY — System Overview

## 1. Introduction

**YOPY** is a web-based platform designed to provide a **safe, interactive, and educational digital environment for children**, while allowing **parents to supervise and monitor their activity**.

The system integrates:

* educational mini-games
* child profile customization
* performance tracking
* parental dashboards
* administrative management tools

The primary objective is to create a platform where **children can learn and play**, while **parents maintain visibility over their progress and digital behavior**.

The system is implemented using:

* **Backend:** PHP
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
* **Database:** MySQL

The architecture follows a **modular MVC structure**, separating presentation, application logic, and data management.

Features include:

* activity history
* score statistics
* performance analysis
* child account management

Data is retrieved from game session records.

---

## Administration Module

The administration module enables system control.

Capabilities include:

* user management
* game management
* system monitoring
* platform maintenance

# 5. High-Level Architecture

The platform follows a **three-layer web architecture**.

```
Client Layer
│
├── Browser
│      ├── HTML
│      ├── CSS
│      └── JavaScript
│
Application Layer
│
├── PHP Controllers
├── Business Logic
└── Game Logic
│
Data Layer
│
└── MySQL Database
```

### Client Layer

The client layer manages:

* user interface rendering
* user interaction
* animations and visual feedback

This layer is implemented using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap**.

---

### Application Layer

The application layer contains:

* request handling
* business logic
* game logic
* authentication processing

This layer is implemented in **PHP**.

---

### Data Layer

The data layer stores all persistent system data.

Key stored elements include:

* user accounts
* child profiles
* games
* game sessions
* scores

The database is implemented using **MySQL**.

---

# 6. Security Considerations

The system integrates several security mechanisms.

### Authentication Security

* password hashing
* session management
* role-based access control

### Data Protection

* restricted access to child data
* input validation
* SQL injection prevention

### Platform Integrity

Administrative monitoring allows detection of abnormal activity.
