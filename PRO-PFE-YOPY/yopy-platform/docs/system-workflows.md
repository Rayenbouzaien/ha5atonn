# YOPY — System Workflows

## 1. Overview

This document describes the **main operational workflows of the YOPY platform**.
Workflows represent the sequence of actions performed by users and system components during typical interactions.

The objective is to clarify:

* how users interact with the system
* how requests are processed internally
* how data flows between modules
* how results are stored and displayed

The main workflows include:

1. User authentication
2. Child game session
3. Score recording
4. Parent dashboard monitoring
5. Administrative management

# 2. User Authentication Workflow

The authentication workflow allows users to securely access the platform.

### Process Description

1. User opens the login page.
2. Credentials are entered.
3. The server validates the information.
4. A secure session is created.
5. The user is redirected based on their role.

# 5. Score Recording Workflow

At the end of the game, the system calculates and stores the score.

### Process Description

1. Game ends.
2. Score engine calculates results.
3. Session information is collected.

# 7. Child Account Management Workflow

Parents can manage child accounts.

### Process Description

1. Parent opens account management.
2. Parent adds or edits a child profile.
3. System validates the input.
4. Data is stored in the database.

# 8. Administrative Management Workflow

Administrators manage system resources and user accounts.

### Process Description

1. Admin logs into the platform.
2. Admin accesses the administration panel.
3. Admin manages users or games.
4. System updates the database.

### Workflow Diagram

```text

# 10. Workflow Benefits

Documenting workflows provides several advantages:

* clarifies system behavior
* simplifies debugging
* improves system maintenance
* helps developers understand interactions

These workflows represent the **operational backbone of the YOPY platform**, ensuring that user actions, gameplay interactions, and monitoring operations are processed in a structured and reliable manner.
