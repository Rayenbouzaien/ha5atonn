# YOPY — Database Schema

## 1. Overview

This document defines the **relational database structure** used by the YOPY platform.
The schema is designed to support:

* user authentication
* child account management
* game sessions
* score tracking
* parental monitoring
* administrative management

The database system used is **MySQL**.

The schema follows **normalized relational design principles** to ensure:

* data consistency
* minimal redundancy
* efficient querying

# 11. Database Relationships

Complete simplified relational structure:

```text
users
  │
  ├── parents
  │       │
  │       └── children
  │               │
  │               ├── characters
  │               │
  │               └── game_sessions
  │                       │
  │                       ├── games
  │                       │
  │                       └── scores
  │
  └── admins
```

# 12. Indexing Strategy

To improve query performance, the following indexes are recommended:

| Table         | Indexed Column |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| users         | email          |
| users         | username       |
| children      | parent_id      |
| game_sessions | child_id       |
| game_sessions | game_id        |
| scores        | session_id     |

---

# 13. Data Integrity Constraints

Important constraints include:

* **foreign key enforcement**
* **cascade deletion where appropriate**
* **unique email constraint for users**
* **non-null authentication fields**

Example constraints:

```
users.email UNIQUE
children.parent_id NOT NULL
scores.session_id NOT NULL
```

---

# 14. Security Considerations

The database schema supports several security practices:

### Password Security

Passwords are stored using **secure hashing algorithms** (e.g., bcrypt).

### Access Control

Application-level access control ensures:

* children access only their games
* parents access only their children
* admins manage global resources

### Data Protection

Sensitive information is protected through:

* input validation
* prepared SQL statements
* restricted database permissions

---

# 15. Future Extensions

The schema can be extended to support additional features such as:

* achievements or badges
* learning analytics
* adaptive difficulty algorithms
* AI-driven game recommendations

These features can be implemented without major modifications to the existing schema.
